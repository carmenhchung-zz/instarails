# INSTARAILS - Version 1

## Task

We were asked to build a web application using Ruby on Rails that is similar to Instagram, without the use of scaffolding (or over reliance upon gems).

## Synopsis

Initially, the gem [acts-as-voteable](https://github.com/ryanto/acts_as_votable) was used to implement the liking function (i.e. how users would like other user's photos). When asked to re-do the application without the use of the gem, the focus was on commenting on (rather than liking) photos.

Currently, the application allows you to create an account and sign in (using the devise gem), upload photos, edit old photos, comment on other's photos, and create a profile page.

## Further Work

The liking function needs to be implemented again without the use of a gem.
